            My name is Thomas, and I am the creator of this website. The reason the Home page is about cheese is because I couldn't think of anything else to put there, and I like cheese.
            Originally, I am a physics student from the Netherlands, but I took an interest in computer science so decided to use my minor to explore that interest. Just today, Sunday September 11th, I moved into my new apartment on campus, which was a bit of a hassle and also the reason why I am typing this at 2 AM.
            In my spare time I like to:
            <ul>
                <li>Play video games</li>
                <li>Watch movies</li>
                <li>Hang out with friends</li>
                <li>Play squash, which I unfortunately have not been able to do yet here in Växjö</li>
            </ul>
            If you don't know, squash is a game similar to tennis, where both players play on the same court alternatingly hitting the ball against a wall. <br>
            The court looks like this: <br>

            Playing video games is a nice past time to have, but it did inadvertently cause me to not attend lectures in person. During CS lectures I like to take the time to try out some code for myself, but as I have a gaming PC and not a laptop I cannot do that in class, so I have live-streamed the lectures up until now. There are two big problems with this:
            <ul>
                <li>I won't meet the lecturer(s) or my classmates</li>
                <li>I am quite unable to concentrate on studying in my own room, as there are distractions lurking around every corner (such as video games)</li>
            </ul>

            As I've mentioned video games this often, I'll include a top 3:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Dark Souls</li>
                <li>Flower</li>
                <li>Undertale</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            I will show you some footage from the video game Flower, as it is very beautiful.<br>
